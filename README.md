Project of a risk analyst for a bank 

## Credit Card Offer Acceptance - Classification Project
This project aims to build a classification model to predict why some bank customers accept credit card offers while others do not. It was developed as part of a case study for risk analysis in a banking context. The dataset includes 18,000 customer records, focusing on demographic and financial characteristics.

### Mission
The bank wants to:
- Understand customer behaviors related to credit card offers.
- Use these insights to improve marketing strategies and customer targeting.

### Key Objectives
- Build a model to predict credit card offer acceptance.
- Compare different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees) to find the best fit.
- Visualize customer trends and patterns using **Tableau** for further insights.

### Dataset Features
- **Offer Accepted** (Yes/No)
- **Reward Program** (e.g., cashback)
- **Income Level** (Low, Medium, High)
- **Credit Rating** (Low, Medium, High)
- **Average Balance** and more.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Tableau** for data visualization
- **Machine Learning** models for classification
